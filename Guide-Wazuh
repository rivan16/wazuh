What is SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It’s like a smart security system for a company’s computers and networks.

Imagine a big room with lots of computers and devices. Every device (like your laptop, printer, or server) sends out signals or messages about what’s happening—like when someone logs in, opens a file, or tries to connect to the internet.

What Does SIEM Do?
Collects Information: SIEM gathers all these messages (also called "logs") from different devices in one place.
Monitors for Problems: It watches these logs to look for anything unusual or suspicious, like someone trying to hack into the system or accessing something they shouldn't.
Sends Alerts: If SIEM finds something bad, it sends an alert to the security team, letting them know what’s happening so they can fix it.
Helps Investigate: SIEM keeps a record of all the logs. So, if a company thinks something bad happened, they can look back and see exactly what occurred.
Why Is SIEM Important?
It’s like having a security guard that watches over all the computers and networks 24/7, making sure everything is safe. And if something goes wrong, the guard sounds the alarm right away!

Example:
Without SIEM: A company might have trouble knowing if someone is trying to hack them because all their devices are sending logs separately.
With SIEM: All the information comes together in one place, making it easier to spot problems quickly.
In Summary:
SIEM helps organizations stay safe by collecting, monitoring, and analyzing all security-related activities across their computers and networks in real-time. It keeps an eye out for bad guys trying to break in!

*****Be sure to disable Real-time Protection and Firewall on Windows Defender and any security option that may block suspicious files on your browser of choice for the testing purposes!*****

8. ENABLING FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING FOR DIRECTORIES

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security process that checks and monitors files and directories on a system for changes, such as modifications, deletions, or additions. The goal of FIM is to detect unauthorized or suspicious activity that might indicate a security breach or malicious behavior.

How FIM Works:
Baseline Creation: FIM first creates a snapshot (baseline) of important files' current state. This includes file attributes like size, permissions, hashes (such as SHA or MD5), and more.

Ongoing Monitoring: After the baseline is set, the system continuously monitors these files and compares their current state to the baseline.

Alerting on Changes: If any unauthorized or unexpected changes are detected—such as someone modifying a file or deleting it—FIM generates an alert to notify administrators.

Common Use Cases:
Monitoring system and configuration files.
Detecting malware infections or file tampering.
Ensuring compliance with security regulations.
In summary, FIM helps to ensure that critical files remain unchanged unless authorized, providing a safeguard against cyberattacks or accidental damage.
